# C#
C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.

## Classes and objects.
Everything in C# is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 
### For example: 
* In real life, a **car is an object**. The car has **attributes**, such as *weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake*.
* **A Class** is like an object `constructor`, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Properties and Encapsulation.
**Encapsulation**, is to make sure that *"sensitive" data is hidden from users*. To achieve this, you must:
* declare fields/variables as `private`
* provide `public` `get` and `set` methods, through **properties**, to access and update the value of a `private` field
